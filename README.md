## Description and Usage
This repository contains documentation of analyses of wildlife indicators (e.g., populations, habitat) as they relate to forestry and timber supply reviews. 

All analyses documented here should be considered as draft examples of analyses that may have completed for timber supply review. They do not necessarily represent information that was used in any allowable annual cut determination.

## Getting Help or Reporting an Issue
If you find any errors with the code, or have any suggestions for improvement, please submit them via the github "Issues" tab.

For more information on analyses documented here, please contact Tyler Muhly (tyler.muhly@gov.bc.ca), Acting Team Lead, Strategic Analysis, Forest Analysis and Inventory Branch, Office of the Chief Forester, Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development.

## Requirements
The model is coded using the R programming language. Thus, you will need to download program R to work with the code, but don't worry, it's free, open-source software. We also recommend downloading the free version of RStudio, which provides a nice integrated development environment for working with R.

R consists of many 'packages' developed by R users that bundle-up specific functions for manipulating, analyzing and visualizing aspatail and spatial data. The packages needed to run CLUS are documented in the respective pieces of code where they are used, and we do not list them all here.
